# superfund-proximity
I look into a how a wood treatment facility impacted a low-income neighborhood in Eugene, Oregon for decades. I found this story by joining datasets. For more about this piece, check out the story and repo here.

## What is this story about?

 This project examines a small community’s fight against a wood treatment facility that polluted groundwater and air, and released hazardous waste for decades in Eugene, Oregon.

 The reported story is published here: **[A guilty plea was just the beginning.](https://ananyabchetia.github.io/contaminated/)**

 The project also investigates how many public schools are located within one mile of a Superfund site. This repository contains the data, analysis and code used to discover this.

## File structure

### 1. scrollytelling_images

 Contains assets used for the scrollytelling portion of the story built with Scrollama. Graphics were created using Google Earth imagery, Adobe Illustrator and ai2html.

### 2. all_datasets

### Stores all dataset folders used in the reporting and analysis for this project:

#### a. FOIA - Public records of odor complaints from the wood treatment facility in Eugene, Oregon.

#### b. PDFs_of_superfunds - EPA PDFs listing proposed and active Superfund sites.

#### c. Superfund_list_csv - CSV files generated from the EPA Superfund PDFs. These cleaned files can be used directly instead of scraping the PDFs.

#### d. public_school_dataset - Excel file containes public school locations across the United States and a derived CSV showing that nearly 1,800 public schools are located within one mile of a Superfund site.

### 3. Google_Maps_API

#### This folder contains an interactive Google Maps API–powered tool that lets users evaluate environmental risk by measuring the proximity of schools and homes to Superfund sites. Scroll down and find this tool at the end of this **[story](https://ananyabchetia.github.io/contaminated/)**.

#### Note: This interactive component was added after the story was published in March.

#### Important: The tool cannot be run locally, as it relies on a Google Maps API key that is restricted to my website for security reasons.

## Workflow

### 1. first_notebook.ipynb:

#### Uses geospatial analysis to identify public schools located within one mile of Superfund sites.

#### Specifically uses GeoPandas for spatial operations, reprojects geometries to EPSG:5070 and applies a one-mile buffer to calculate proximity.

### 2. second_notebook.ipynb:

#### Cleans FOIA-requested complaint data and formats it for a Datawrapper visualization.

## Final

### This story involved reading dozens of court records, filing public records requests, interviewing vulnerable sources and combining data with in-depth reporting. (And yes, all under a tight deadline.)
