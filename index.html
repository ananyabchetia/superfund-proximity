          Oregon native Arjorie Arberry-Baribeault always had a razor sharp eye for styling hair.
          But when her daughter Zion was diagnosed with cancer at thirteen years old, followed by
          her best friend's son a few years later with the same diagnoses, Baribeault left the
          beauty industry for good in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Doing hair wasn't fun after my daughter started to lose her hair, I didn't care what
          anybody's hair was doing. I didn't care if it was thin on this part, or if they didn't
          like the color, if it was graying too fast,” Baribeault said. “It's not fair to do that to
          my clients.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bairibeault dug for answers online and discovered JH Baxter, a wood treatment facility in
          West Eugene, Oregon, was using wood preservatives like creosote, pentachlorophenol and
          arsenate threatening to one's respiratory system and organs. She and her family lived near
          JH Baxter, along with eight other industrial sites for years.
        </p>

          found that cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, the cancer Zion had, was slightly higher in
          neighborhoods surrounding JH Baxter compared to the county or state in 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Zion is cancer free and JH Baxter pleaded guilty in January to emitting hazardous
          waste beyond the limits set by the Clean Air Act and working without a permit, a violation
          of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The company's president, 61-year-old
          <a

          >
          also pleaded guilty to making false statements to Oregon inspectors on how the facility
          handled releasing hazardous waste and was ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judge Michael McShane sentenced Baxter-Krause to 90 days on April 22. Baxtet said she was
          ashamed many times and felt remorse everyday at the sentencing. She apologized to Bethel
          residents, the neighborhood across from JH Baxter, and admitted she needed to be more
          honest with regulators, said journalist Brian Bull, who attended the sentencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          West Eugene resident Lisa Dion said she couldn't feel her feet after hearing the weak
          sentence and a rush of “anxiety, nervousness [and] anger” kicked in. McShane said a causal
          link between Baxter plant emissions and health issues from locals could not be
          established, according to reporting from
          <a

          Lisa's husband, Eric, is in treatment for diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor, a
          rare slow growing brain tumor that mostly affects children for the last three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The couple are convinced living next to the facility led to Eric's cancer. Eric, who grew
          up right across the facility, still remembers the pungent odor stinging from JH Baxter in
          the 1980s.
        </p>
        <p>“I paid no attention to it,” Eric said about the smell.</p>
        <p>
          JH Baxter violated environmental regulations for decades but was only charged based on
          actions committed between Jan 2, 2019 and Oct 6, 2019. There are over 20 instances where
          three environmental agencies warned JH Baxter for going against air and water quality
          standards and hazardous waste regulations, according to a timeline from
          <a ahref="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/61e11e3a99a54ff784a68ffacaccffcc"

          research team. Nearby residents filed over three thousand complaints between 2002 to 2022
          about the facility's smell.

          Using student self-reported data and research from state nonprofit Beyond Toxics Waste,

          combination of biology and humanity subjects.

        <p>
          She also relied on the EPA's Environmental Justice Screening tool, which points out what
          areas in the nation are vulnerable to pollution, floods and other climate related issues.
          But with the Trump administration removing the tool,, Ferguson said it has been difficult
          to show how JH Baxter impacts the surrounding area.

          A 2023
          <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/deq/Programs/Documents/JHBMeetingsummary071223.pdf"
            >report from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the U.S.
            Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a
          >
          found that seven residential yards had soil “with dioxin concentrations over 40 parts per
          trillion (ppt).” This meant children under six years old in contact with bare soil for a
          year or longer were at high risk. DEQ found an additional four more yards with dangerous
          levels of dioxin concentration a year later.
        </p>
        <p>
          “DEQ has completed residential yard cleanup at seven of the 11 yards identified,” said
          Dylan Darlings, a public affairs specialist at the DEQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DEQ has spent about $2.6 million on cleaning up yards and all activities related to
          it. The agency relied on the Orphan Fund, which is used to cover the clean up costs. But
          JH Baxter is the responsible party for the cleanup and has been billed to pay, Darlings
          said. The site also owes over $350,000 in fines to the agency which increases with
          interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          JH Baxter's recent case focused on none of this. The court found that JH Baxter
          transferred wastewater to a wood treatment retort to "boil it off” between January 2,
          2019, to October 6, 2019 and would send the remaining waste to an offsite for disposal.
          The site did not have the permit to remove the waste which violated the Resource
          Conservation and Recovery Act.

            >Retorts</a
          >
          are cylindrical vessels where chemicals are forced into the wood to preserve the material
          and make it resistant to insects.The wastewater would discharge into the air which meant
          the facility dismissed the Clean Air Act emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants,
          according to court records.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the DEQ asked how many times JH Baxter used the retorts and requested for a
          documented record of the process, Baxter-Krause wrote back that "[J.H.] Baxter does not
          have specific dates when this practice occurred.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The court found employees actually had "detailed daily production logs for each retort,”
          and the facility boiled off hazardous waste for 136 known days using multiple retorts.
          Baxter-Krause previously emailed only one retort was used.
        </p>
        <p>After the sentencing, Baribeault walked up to Lisa and they both hugged.</p>
        <p>"[She] cried & I cried with her," Lisa said. "Lots of anger for the weak sentence."</p>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.epa.gov/or/jh-baxter-wood-treating-facility-cleanup-investigation"
            >EPA proposed</a
          >
          JH Baxter to be on EPA's Superfund's National Priority List last September, a list of
          hazardous waste sites that are considered to be the nation's most serious uncontrolled or
          abandoned releases of contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agency can use federal funding called superfund for cleanup and enforcement on
          hazardous sites. The boundary of the superfund site can extend beyond JH Baxter but it is
          too early to say whether homes will be in the site boundary right now, said Alice
          Corcoran, a public affairs specialist with the EPA.

              <p>This story started with dataset I built from scratch.</p>
              <p>
                I found a list of proposed and current Superfund sites in the National Priorities
                List by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA identifies these sites for
                long-term cleanup due to the presence of toxic waste that poses a risk to human
                health or the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I then found all U.S public schools listed under the National Center for Education
                Statistics. The NCES also lists data on demographics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using GeoPandas and buffering method, I joined the two datasets and discovered 1792
                public schools are within a mile away from a current Superfund sites. I also joined
                proposed Superfund sites with public schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's where I discovered JH Baxter and reached out to locals to understand more.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the main questions I always wonder as a reporter is, how has this impacted
                residents and how are they responding?
